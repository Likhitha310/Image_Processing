# Image Processing
To visualize images using ML

IMAGE-PROCCESSING-TECHNIQUES
1. Pixel Access:
   - Accessing pixel values (BGR format).

2. Digital Image:
   - Loading and representing a discrete image.

3. Resolution:
   - Obtaining the number of pixels in the image.

4. Grayscale:
   - Converting the image to shades of gray.

5. Color Spaces:
   - Representing colors using RGB and HSV models.

6. Histogram:
   - Visualizing the distribution of pixel intensities.

7. Thresholding:
   - Classifying pixels as foreground or background based on intensity.

8. Convolution:
   - Applying a kernel for modifying pixel intensities.

9. Smoothing and Blurring:
   - Reducing noise and creating a smoother image.

10. Edge Detection:
    - Identifying boundaries within an image.

11. Morphological Operations (Erosion):
    - Modifying the shape or structure of an image.

12. Image Transformation (Rotation):
    - Rotating the image.

13. Image Filtering:
    - Enhancing or suppressing certain features in an image.

14. Feature Extraction:
    - Identifying and extracting relevant features.

15. Image Segmentation:
    - Dividing the image into meaningful parts.

16. Object Recognition:
    - Identifying and classifying objects within an image.

17. Image Compression:
    - Reducing the size of an image.

18. Image Registration:
    - Aligning multiple images for comparison.

19. Image Restoration:
    - Recovering an image from degradation caused by noise.

20. Computer Vision:
    - The broader field that encompasses image processing.

21. Image Gradients (Sobel, Scharr, Prewitt):
    - Calculating gradients to highlight edges.

22. Canny Edge Detection:
    - Detecting edges in an image.

23. Image Enhancement:
    - Improving the visibility of features in an image.

24. Face Detection:
    - Using Haar cascade classifier to detect faces.

25. Displaying Images:
    - Visualizing the results of image processing operations.
